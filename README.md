Instructions for use:
- Clone the full repository.
- Run the application (no parameters needed) in your favourite IDE. I have used IntelliJ.
- The high-level code is in the main() function in the Simulator class.
- The output consists of simple System.out statements, so it is probably shown in some console tab in the IDE.
